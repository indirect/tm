# tm

## What?

tm wraps `mate` in a warm, project-opening embrace. You can open TextMate project files by name, with tab-completion.

## Installation

Create `~/.tmproj` and save your TextMate projects into it. Check out this project, and put the `tm` binary somewhere you can execute it. Then you can just run `tm foo` to open `~/.tmproj/foo.tmproj`.

For extra goodness, see `setup.sh`, which gives `mate` tm's powers, namely opening TextMate projects by name, and tab-completion entries for projects.
